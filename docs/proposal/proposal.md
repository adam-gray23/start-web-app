## SECTION B


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

### Outline

> For this project we plan to create a Web Application using (). This would consist of the following key features:

* Language-Sensitive Editor: Our web application features a language-sensitive code editor that understands the unique syntax of START. This editor provides real-time feedback, highlighting code errors and suggesting improvements, helping you grasp the language's intricacies effortlessly.

* Interactive Learning: Whether you're a complete beginner or have some coding experience, the START Web Application offers a range of learning resources and tutorials tailored to your level. Step-by-step lessons and exercises ensure a smooth learning curve.

* Debugger: Debugging your code is a breeze with our built-in debugger. Identify and resolve issues in your programs using breakpoints, variable inspection, and error messages that guide you towards efficient problem-solving.

* Execution Environment: Execute your START code right in the web application. Witness the results of your code as you experiment and practice, gaining confidence and skills in real-time.

By implementing these core features it will allow for the best user experience.

### Background

> This project idea spawned from our 3rd year project idea to create our own programming language, and given our language is currently only available on GitHub, we wanted to make a more accessible to the average beginner programmer, who may have no previous experience with GitHub. Given this, we wanted to make one place where to user can go to learn and execute their code while using START.

As well as this, we wanted to create a project that would allow us to put our learned experience from INTRA into practice given we both had experience working with small sections of web development. We now want to create our own full web application.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
